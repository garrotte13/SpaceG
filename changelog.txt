Version: 0.3.3
Date: 2022-04-13
  Changes:
        - Crusher graphics replacement (APM instead of Yuoki's)
        - Burner-fuel crusher added (no steel or stone-brick is required)
        - Stone brick is made of silica instead of stone ore, therefore crushing stone is essential step of early progress
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.2
Date: 2022-04-11
  Changes:
      - Advanced Beam Turret recipe switched to Titanium and Zirconium plates ingredients
      - FlameTurret recipe change: 5 steel replaced by 40 Zirconia
      - Crusher energy consumption reduced 350->250KW, crafting speed 50% increased
      - Immersite isn't placed anymore. Got an idea where to go from now      
      - Reducing rocks free zircon in BZ Zircon mod
      - Welcoming BZ Tungsten mod - balance fixes, adding it in laser turret. Still the only way to survive is a start tungsten patch option.
      - Futile attempts to make mineral water starting location autoplacing - didn't work to make it part of tungsten mining.
      - BZ Foundry mod welcoming doesn't go well - this mod requires replacing graphics and separating coke production from founding. For now fixed crusher tech dependency.
  Warfare rebalance changes (to be forked later):
      - fish consumption cooldown is tripled. Other nerfs are coming...

Version: 0.1.0
