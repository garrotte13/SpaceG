Version: 0.3.4
Date: 2022-04-28
  Changes:
        - Another Brevven's brilliant mod integrated - bztungsten. Most work was done in forked Brevven's bzfoundry customization, but some balance fixes here.
        - Fire blowtorch parts item added for more reasonable flamethrower weapons and turrets. Depends essentially on bztungsten mod.
        - Advanced flamethower turret requires basic flamethrower turrets as ingredient when bztungsten is loaded.
        - Steel furnace became almost twice more expensive when bztungsten + bzzirconium are loaded.
        - Electric furnace recipe is more simple - half of ingredients are replaced by a half of steel furnace.
        - Test code added for factorio API capabilities research (but not loaded in game).
        - Fixed locale texts.
        - Fixing sounds for RampantIndustry airfilters (MIT licensed taken from Krastorio2).

Version: 0.3.3
Date: 2022-04-13
  Changes:
        - Crusher graphics replacement (APM instead of Yuoki's)
        - Burner-fuel crusher added (no steel or stone-brick is required)
        - Stone brick is made of silica instead of stone ore, therefore crushing stone is essential step of early progress
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.2
Date: 2022-04-11
  Changes:
      - Advanced Beam Turret recipe switched to Titanium and Zirconium plates ingredients
      - FlameTurret recipe change: 5 steel replaced by 40 Zirconia
      - Crusher energy consumption reduced 350->250KW, crafting speed 50% increased
      - Immersite isn't placed anymore. Got an idea where to go from now      
      - Reducing rocks free zircon in BZ Zircon mod
      - Welcoming BZ Tungsten mod - balance fixes, adding it in laser turret. Still the only way to survive is a start tungsten patch option.
      - Futile attempts to make mineral water starting location autoplacing - didn't work to make it part of tungsten mining.
      - BZ Foundry mod welcoming doesn't go well - this mod requires replacing graphics and separating coke production from founding. For now fixed crusher tech dependency.
  Warfare rebalance changes (to be forked later):
      - fish consumption cooldown is tripled. Other nerfs are coming...

Version: 0.1.0
Date: 2022-01-30
  Changes:
      - Sentinel added (doubled size and balanced mechanics - it was a too small masterpiece from Krastor. And one-tile building is too small).
